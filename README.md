# Project MMEE
This is my first Github repository: **Project MMEE (Mythic Mobs Extension Extension)**, which will be based on small `JavaScript` scripts and the `jsmechanic` capability that is offered by MME.

To include these scripts, you must add them to `plugins\MythicMobsExtension\Includes.js` and restart MythicMobs.

I have tested this repository alongside MM 4.6.5 and MM 4.7, and I have concluded that it works in both versions but (at least in my own experience) it works best in 4.6.5.

- `@RogerPlaysMC#1649` for pointing me to the Spigot API.
- `@Magnus Frost#4005` for pointing me towards useful documentation.
- `@Grima#3467` and `@爛爛#9986`, as I've implemented some of their suggestions.
