# Introduction
This is a list of all the available mechanics and conditions that are currently available. More may be gradually added. The following must be taken into consideration for their correct use:
- The character `&` must be replaced by `ยง`
- It is important to define all the properties of a skill, as that will ensure that no errors occur
- If specified, the text must be quoted. Not quoting it will likely result in unintended behaviour

# Conditions
